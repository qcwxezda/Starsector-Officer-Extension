>>> 0.6.7
- Periodically resets the number-of-exceptional-pod-officers-created count to the number in sector plus however many have ever
  been in the player's fleet, making it more consistently possible to find 4 per sector.
- Now temporarily removes all suspended officers from fleet and sets player officer count to a high number whenever you
  open an interaction dialog, adds suspended officers back and resets player officer count when the game unpauses.
    - This should finally cause battle difficulty calculations to not include suspended officers.
    - Also allows events that check officer count (Luddic path bar event, modded events that add officers) to always allow
      said officer to be added / hired.
- Renamed LunaLib settings to include mod prefix, will reset settings if you've changed them
- Filter officers button now only shows the 14 vanilla combat skills

>>> 0.6.6
- Added a console command to locate level 7 cryopod officers
- Fixed issue with cryopod officers not retaining the correct number of elite skills

>>> 0.6.5
- Hotfix for Nexerelin issue; adjusted difficulty calculation will no longer work with Nex or any other mod that
  uses a modified FleetEncounterContext

>>> 0.6.4
- Hotfix for a silent crash when computing battle difficulty for a modded fleet using a custom extension of FleetInteractionDialogPluginImpl

>>> 0.6.3
- Added LunaLib support
- Battle difficulty calculation no longer takes unassigned officers past the vanilla maximum (sorted in descending level order) into account
   -For example, if you have 3 assigned officers and 12 unassigned officers that are not officers, mercenaries, or AI cores, and you have an assigned officer limit of 8,
    only the 5 highest-level unassigned officers will be counted toward battle difficulty.
