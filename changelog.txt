>>> 0.6.6
- Added a console command to locate level 7 cryopod officers

>>> 0.6.5
- Hotfix for Nexerelin issue; adjusted difficulty calculation will no longer work with Nex or any other mod that
  uses a modified FleetEncounterContext

>>> 0.6.4
- Hotfix for a silent crash when computing battle difficulty for a modded fleet using a custom extension of FleetInteractionDialogPluginImpl

>>> 0.6.3
- Added LunaLib support
- Battle difficulty calculation no longer takes unassigned officers past the vanilla maximum (sorted in descending level order) into account
   -For example, if you have 3 assigned officers and 12 unassigned officers that are not officers, mercenaries, or AI cores, and you have an assigned officer limit of 8,
    only the 5 highest-level unassigned officers will be counted toward battle difficulty.
