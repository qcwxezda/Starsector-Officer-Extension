>>> 0.6.3
- Added LunaLib support
- Battle difficulty calculation no longer takes unassigned officers past the vanilla maximum (sorted in descending level order) into account
   -For example, if you have 3 assigned officers and 12 unassigned officers that are not officers, mercenaries, or AI cores, and you have an assigned officer limit of 8,
    only the 5 highest-level unassigned officers will be counted toward battle difficulty.
